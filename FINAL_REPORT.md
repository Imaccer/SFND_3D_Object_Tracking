# Final Project Report

| Criteria | Submission Requirements | Description | Code Reference |
|----------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|
| FP.0 Writeup / README | Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. The writeup / README should include a statement and supporting figures / images that explain how each rubric item was addressed, and specifically where in the code each step was handled. | This document explains how each rubric item was addressed in the code, including supporting figures and images where applicable. | N/A |
| FP.1 Match 3D Objects | Implement the method `matchBoundingBoxes`, which takes as input both the previous and the current data frames and provides as output the IDs of the matched regions of interest (i.e., the `boxID` property). Matches must be the ones with the highest number of keypoint correspondences. | The method `matchBoundingBoxes` was implemented to match bounding boxes with the highest number of keypoint correspondences between consecutive frames. | `matchBoundingBoxes` function in `camFusion_Student.cpp` |
| FP.2 Compute Lidar-based TTC | Compute the time-to-collision in seconds for all matched 3D objects using only Lidar measurements from the matched bounding boxes between current and previous frame. | The TTC was computed using Lidar measurements, ensuring robustness to outlier points. | `computeTTCLidar` function in `camFusion_Student.cpp` |
| FP.3 Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes | Prepare the TTC computation based on camera measurements by associating keypoint correspondences to the bounding boxes which enclose them. All matches which satisfy this condition must be added to a vector in the respective bounding box. | Keypoint correspondences were associated with the respective bounding boxes and outliers were removed based on Euclidean distance. | `clusterKptMatchesWithROI` function in `camFusion_Student.cpp` |
| FP.4 Compute Camera-based TTC | Compute the time-to-collision in seconds for all matched 3D objects using only keypoint correspondences from the matched bounding boxes between current and previous frame. | The TTC was computed using camera measurements, with robust handling of outlier correspondences. | `computeTTCCamera` function in `camFusion_Student.cpp` |
| FP.5 Performance Evaluation 1 | Find examples where the TTC estimate of the Lidar sensor does not seem plausible. Describe your observations and provide a sound argumentation why you think this happened. | Several examples were identified where the Lidar-based TTC estimates were implausible, with detailed observations and explanations provided. | In `LidarTTC_Graph.png` point 3 and 8 are higher than is feasible. Given the constant velocity model, would expect to see lidar points on top down view at much higher value of xMin to account for larger TTC. What is actually happening is the velocity of the car in front towards the ego car is decreasing (xMinPrev - xMinCurr is smaller between these frames). The TTC equation assumes constant velocity and so cannot handle this properly. The denominator of the equation, i.e., xMinPrev-xMinCurr, is smaller between frames due to the deceleration, this causes the higher TTC estimate for the constant velocity model (see rows 4 and 9 of `LidarTTC.csv`.) |
| FP.6 Performance Evaluation 2 | Run several detector/descriptor combinations and look at the differences in TTC estimation. Find out which methods perform best and also include several examples where camera-based TTC estimation is way off. As with Lidar, describe your observations again and also look into potential reasons. | Different detector/descriptor combinations were compared, with analysis on their performance and explanations for discrepancies in camera-based TTC estimation. | The results of several detector/descriptor combinations is given in `performance_metrics.csv`(row numbers are noted in the following).   The camera-based equation for TTC:  TTC = -dT / (1 - medDistRatio) runs into issues when medDistRatio <= 1. If it's less than 1, TTC -> -VE. If it's equal to 1, TTC -> -inf.  Examples of this can be seen for particular detector/descriptor combinations: FAST/FREAK (188), ORB/BRIEF (298), ORB/ORB (317, 319), ORB/FREAK (330, 335, 343), ORB/SIFT (347, 353). The case of the medDistRatio = 1 indicates that the distance ratio between descriptors has not changed between frames which would violate the constant velocity assumption (i.e., the car in front has not moved sufficiently to change the ratio). In the case of medDistRatio < 1, that would imply that the car in front is moving away from the ego car (again, the constant velocity model cannot account for this). |
